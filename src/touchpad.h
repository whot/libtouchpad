/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * **libtouchpad** is a library for handling touchpad events, including the
 * conversion of events to motion, scroll, button and other events. It
 * abstracts the actual touchpad handling to be usable from various
 * backends. These backends include a simple commandline tool, an X.Org
 * input driver and (in the future) drivers for wayland compositors.
 *
 * Requirements
 * ============
 * **libtouchpad** requires [libevdev](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/)
 *
 *
 * License information
 * ===================
 * libevdev is licensed under the
 * [X11 license](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libevdev/tree/COPYING).

/**
 * @page tapping Tap-to-Click behavior and configuration
 *
 * Tap-to-click is a behavior where a short finger press and release
 * triggers a button press and release. For a touch to be converted to such
 * a button press the following conditions must be met:
 * + the release of the finger is within the tap timeout
 * + the finger must move less than the tap move threshold
 *
 * Two taps in quick succession (within the permitted timeout) will cause
 * two button events to be generated.
 *
 * Note that libtouchpad differs between tapping and button events see (@ref
 * callbackinterface). In the context of tapping, a "button event" is the
 * event generated by a tap and can be either a press or release event.
 * Most use-cases will handle a single-finger tap event like a left mouse button
 * event.
 *
 * Multi-finger tapping
 * ====================
 *
 * A multi-finger tap is defined as one or more fingers down, with the last
 * finger defining the actual finger number. i.e. one finger down and a
 * second finger tapping will trigger a two-finger tap, provided the above
 * conditions are met for the last finger.
 *
 * libtouchpad currently supports up to three-finger taps.
 *
 * Tap-and-Drag
 * ============
 *
 * If a tap is triggered and followed by a touch-and-hold, the button is
 * only pressed once and held down. The button is released once the last
 * finger leaves the touchpad, allowing a user to e.g. drag an item.
 *
 * Documentation
 * =============
 * See [tap state diagram](touchpad-tap-state-machine.svg) for a graph.
 */

/**
 * @page scrolling Scrolling gesture recognition
 *
 * libtouchpad supports two scroll methods: two-finger scrolling and
 * (eventually) edge scrolling
 *
 * Two-finger Scrolling
 * ====================
 * In two-finger scrolling, a movement by more than a given threshold in a
 * direction will trigger a scroll event. For two-finger scrolling to work,
 * exactly two fingers must be on the touchpad. Moving both fingers or
 * holding one and moving the second will trigger scroll events.
 *
 * Two-finger scrolling terminates when one finger leaves the touchpad or a
 * third finger is placed onto the touchpad.
 *
 * Edge Scrolling
 * ====================
 * **Note: not implemented**
 *
 * In edge scrolling, a movement of exactly one fingers along a defined edge
 * by more than a given threshold will trigger a scroll event.
 *
 * Edge scrolling terminates when the finger leaves the touchpad or a second
 * finger is placed onto the touchpad.
 *
 * Scroll Direction Lock
 * =====================
 * Once a scroll gesture has started, the scroll direction and method is
 * locked and will not change until the scroll terminates. For example, if a
 * vertical two-finger scroll has been triggerd, sideways movement will not
 * trigger horizontal scrolling.
 */

/**
 * @page softbuttons Software-button emulation
 *
 * Clickpads provide only one physical button, BTN_LEFT. Right-button
 * clicks are emulated based on the location of the finger at click-time.
 *
 * libtouchpad supports software buttons, for left, right and middle clicks.
 * The buttons are always aligned in a horizontal layout of user-defined
 * height. Note that a button click with the finger outside of the button
 * area will always result in a left click.
 *
 *      +------------------------+   +------------------------+   +------------------------+
 *	|                        |   |    LEFT    |   RIGHT   |   |                        |

 *	+------------------------+   +------------------------+   +------------------------+
 *
 * Button selection
 * ================
 * A button click for a right button is generated if
 * * the finger clicking is on top of the right button area, or
 * * any other finger is on top of the right button area when a click happens
 *
 * A button click for a right button is not generated if
 * * the finger started outside of the button area and moved into the button
 *   area before the click
 *
 * Finger behavior
 * ===============
 * A finger inside the button area does not generate movement. For the left
 * button area this only affects the area shared with the right button area,
 * not the rest of the touchpad.
 *
 * If a finger leaves the button area and stays outside past a timeout, the
 * finger may generate movement without the need for releasing the finger.
